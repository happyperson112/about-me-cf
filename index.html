        How I'm connected to Cystic Fibrosis
      </h4>
      <p class='connection'>
        My name is Amelia and I'm connected to Cystic Fibrosis because two of my cousins who have Cystic Fibrosis. When my cousin Gavin was two and half he was diagnosed with CF. My Aunt Pam was pregnant with Jake at the time, and we learned he had the disease two months before he was born. The day Lisa- my mom, learned she was pregnant with Matthew- my brother, we found out that he too might have the disease--he does not. And there you have the reality of the punnett square.  
<br>
        Gavin just turned 18 and Jake is 16.  They get up every day and endure countless treatments in order to do what we do without thinking--breathe.  They take enzymes every time they need to eat--otherwise there would be no chance of digesting their food.  They hook up to a machine that literally shakes their lungs twice a day.  These boys, and patients like them, spend at least two hours everyday hooked up to machines that help them stay healthy.  They take over 50 pills and must consume upwards of 4000 calories a day. 
  <br>      
My family is not the only one affected by this disease, there are over 30,000 people in the us alone with Cystic Fibrosis, more than 70,000 world wide. So, you can help make a difference to this community by donating in different ways to help beat this dreadful disease and find a cure.
